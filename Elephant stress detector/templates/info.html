        <h2>Stress & Stereotypic Behavior</h2>
        <p>In captivity, Asian elephants often exhibit <strong>stereotypic behaviors</strong>—repetitive, unvarying
            movements with no obvious goal or function. The most common form is "weaving" or swaying the head and body
            side-to-side.</p>
        <p>This AI model detects these specific high-frequency oscillations to flag potential distress markers early.
        </p>
        <div class="fact-box warning">
            <strong>Key Indicator:</strong> Persistent side-to-side swaying is a primary sign of boredom, frustration,
            or lack of social interaction.

        <h2>Semi-Tamed Behavior & Pinnawala Context</h2>
        <p>The elephants at <strong>Pinnawala</strong> are "semi-tamed," meaning they are accustomed to human presence
            and daily routines (bathing at Ma Oya river, feeding hours) but retain wild instincts.</p>
        <p><strong>Specific Stressors:</strong> Unlike wild herds, Pinnawala elephants may experience stress from:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Restricted movement during non-bathing hours.</li>
            <li>Dominance hierarchies within the orphan group.</li>
            <li>High visitor density.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>This AI model is calibrated to detect the <strong>stereotypic swaying</strong> that specifically arises when
            these intelligent animals are waiting or confined.</p>
